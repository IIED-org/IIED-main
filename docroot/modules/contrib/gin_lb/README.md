### Conflicts with your frontend theme.

To avoid conflicts with your frontend theme, the module adds a
CSS prefix "glb-" to all layout builder styles.
If your theme uses theme suggestions there could be conflicts
with the module theme suggestions from "gin layout builder".
To avoid these conflicts add the following code to your
hook_theme_suggestions inside your theme.

if (isset($variables['element']['#gin_lb_form'])) {
    return;
}

### Develop

#### One time installation step

`nvm install 14`

#### Regular script execution

Gin layout builder comes with a webpack configuration to builder SCSS styles.
To use them run:

`nvm use 14`
`yarn install`
`yarn dev`
