# Search API Solr Log

This module provides an alternative to the DB Logger of Drupal Core.

After enabling the module, visit `/admin/config/search/search-api/server/search_api_solr_log_server/editSolr` and
configure the connection according to your needs.

Note, if you don't have a dedicated log server, you can use the identical settings of an existing server.
But it is important to activate "Advanced / Retrieve result data from Solr".
