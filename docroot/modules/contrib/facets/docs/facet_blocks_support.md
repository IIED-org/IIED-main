# Facets as Blocks

Facets as a block will stay supported for backwards compatibility.
Starting from Facets 3, no AJAX will be supported on Facets as a block.


The recommended way to add Facets to Views in Facets 3 is to use the submodule [Facets Exposed Filters](https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/facets/exposed_filters) instead, which supports native AJAX.
