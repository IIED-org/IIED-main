INTRODUCTION
------------

This project adds an ability to merge node with different languages to one
translated node in Drupal 8. It is a similar functionality that exists in
Drupal 7 where a user can add relations between different nodes with different
languages. After migrating content from D7 translation system to D8, many
things changed. Orphans nodes with different language can't be merged.
This tool adds this functionality for the content editors.
