################
# GitLabCI template for Drupal projects.
#
# This template is designed to give any Contrib maintainer everything they need to test, without requiring modification.
# It is also designed to keep up to date with Core Development automatically through the use of include files that can be centrally maintained.
# As long as you include the project, ref and three files below, any future updates added by the Drupal Association will be used in your
# pipelines automatically. However, you can modify this template if you have additional needs for your project.
# The full documentation is on https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/gitlab_templates/
################

# For information on alternative values for 'ref' see https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/gitlab_templates/info/templates-version/
# To test a Drupal 7 project, change the first include filename from .main.yml to .main-d7.yml
