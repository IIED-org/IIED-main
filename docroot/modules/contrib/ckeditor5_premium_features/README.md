# CKEditor 5 Premium Features

CKEditor 5 Premium features are a module for Drupal 9/10 that will provide a set of collaborative solutions and the ability to export your content to popular portable and cross-platform formats.

At the moment the CKEditor 5 Premium features offer:

 * Real-time collaboration - **optional**, you may use Track changes and Comments without Real-time collaboration too (!)
 * Track changes
 * Comments
 * Revision history - a more sophisticated history of changes inside the document
 * Notifications - configurable notifications to stay up to date whenever someone mentions you in a document, comment, accepts/rejects suggestions, replies to your comment and so on. You may use your own plugin for notifications to get e.g. notifications on slack.
 * Productivity pack - a set of exclusive premium features, that make editing faster, easier, and more efficient.
 * Full screen mode - a free-to-use plugin that allows maximising the editing area.

It also provides the following file formats converters:

 * Export to Word - marked as experimental (works but requires manual corrections to CSS for the best experience).
 * Export to PDF - marked as experimental (works but requires manual corrections to CSS for the best experience).
