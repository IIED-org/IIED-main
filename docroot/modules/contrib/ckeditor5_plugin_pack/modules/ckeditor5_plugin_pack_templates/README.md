# CKEditor 5 Plugin Pack - Templates
This module adds Templates plugin for CKEditor 5 in Drupal 9 and 10.

The template feature allows you to insert predefined content structures into the document. Templates can provide both smaller portions of content (like a formatted table) and base structures for entire documents (for example, a formal letter template). Templates are a useful tool to speed up the writing process and maintain compliance with the companyâ€™s document and content policy.
