  The module provides an image field formatter for the thumbnail field of Media entities. The default thumbnail can be replaced by an image generated from a pdf file referenced in any file field of any Media entity.

  Prerequisite :
  imagick PHP extension.
  spatie/pdf-to-image library: composer require spatie/pdf-to-image.
  If you get pages overlapped in one image (issue from the third library spatie/pdf-to-image, please install patch from : https://www.drupal.org/project/media_pdf_thumbnail/issues/3221786

  Instructions :
  Install spatie/pdf-to-image: composer require spatie/pdf-to-image
  Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module and enabled it.

  Usage :
  Choose the "Media PDF Thumbnail Image" field formatter in the Media entity view mode for thumbnail field and set desired options.
  When rendering the thumbnail field, the image from the file field (the one choosen in the field formatter's options) will be created and stored in a storage entity.
  The storage system is similar to the Redirect module.

  Don't forget to clear caches after any changes for rebuilding the field render.
